This project contains the different markdown files for the (Website/Blog of Margitta Kupler)[https://margitta-kupler.de/]. The original webpage was done in wordpress and the blog is done over the years in one long blogpost. I have written a python script to scrape the content and now there are the different blog-posts one in each markdown file from 2012 until June 2023, which then can be imported into a new webpage/theme.
