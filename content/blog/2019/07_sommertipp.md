**→** Following the preceding Movement and Cognition conferences at Oxford
University and at Joseph B. martin center at Harvard Medical School, the
forthcoming conference shares knowledge on the relation of human movement to
cognitive function. Among the focus areas of the conference include
application to rehabilitation and therapeutics, sport, motor learning, brain-
behavior relationships, traumatic brain injury, gait and cognition, and dance.
We are also focusing this time on female cognitive movement interaction, the
aging brain and gerontology, treatment of traumatic brain injury, neonatal,
infant and child development all in the context of movement and cognition. The
conference will be held on the campus of the University of Tel-Aviv between
22-24.
